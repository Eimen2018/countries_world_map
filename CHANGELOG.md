## 0.0.1

First release. 
At this moment the world map works as expected. It is possible to assign a color to each country. The memory usage seems good, however I have found some problems on the iPad Pro 2018.  

"thread #23, name = 'DartWorker', stop reason = EXC_RESOURCE RESOURCE_TYPE_MEMORY (limit=2867 MB, unused=0x0)"
This only occurs by randomly assign colors to each country at a very highspeed. For normal usage no problems has been found.
